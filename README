We start the server:
php db.php

Simple example (fetchAll)
php example1.php
[{"uid":0,"0":0,"name":"Gonzalo","1":"Gonzalo","surname":"Ayuso","2":"Ayuso"},{"uid":1,"0":1,"name":"Hans","1":"Hans","surname":"Solo","2":"Solo"},{"uid":2,"0":2,"name":"Luke","1":"Luke","surname":"Skywalker","2":"Skywalker"}]

We parse the SQL and create a new statement
php example2.php

We execute our prepared statement
php example3.php
[{"uid":0,"0":0,"name":"Gonzalo","1":"Gonzalo","surname":"Ayuso","2":"Ayuso"},{"uid":1,"0":1,"name":"Hans","1":"Hans","surname":"Solo","2":"Solo"},{"uid":2,"0":2,"name":"Luke","1":"Luke","surname":"Skywalker","2":"Skywalker"}]
